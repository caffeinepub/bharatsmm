  "summary": "The diff implements the majority of the BharatSMM requirements: a Motoko backend actor with service catalog, orders, and balance management; a multi-page React frontend with all six required pages; at least 15 seeded services across the required categories; a dark navy/orange-red visual theme with sidebar layout; and logo display in the sidebar. A few gaps remain: the Add Funds page uses a mock local submission rather than calling a real backend topUp function, backend category filtering is not confirmed in the truncated diff, and the generated logo PNG asset is referenced but not confirmed committed as a binary file.",
