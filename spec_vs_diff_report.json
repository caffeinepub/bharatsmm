  "summary": "The diff shows a comprehensive publish of the BharatSMM application including all frontend pages (Dashboard, New Order, Orders, Services, AddFunds, Profile, AdminDashboard, LoginPage), backend (main.mo), layout/sidebar with logo and conditional Admin Panel link, dark navy/orange-red theme, UPI QR code on AddFunds, service price editing in Admin Panel, and all backend query hooks. The implementation covers virtually all acceptance criteria for REQ-18. The only uncertainty is around actual live deployment since the diff shows code changes but no deployment configuration or CI/CD artifacts.",
