## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Add Funds page to display the correct UPI ID with a copy button and replace the QR code image with the cropped PhonePe QR code.

**Planned changes:**
- Display UPI ID `8825245372-l3c6@ibl` prominently in the Scan & Pay section with a "Copy UPI ID" button
- Add instructional text telling users to pay via any UPI app (PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm, etc.)
- Replace the existing QR code image with the new cropped PhonePe QR code (`bharatsmm-phonepe-qr.dim_400x600.png`)
- Add label "Scan with PhonePe or any UPI app" above the QR code
- Show account holder name "Mr Sandeep Kumar" below the QR code
- Style all new elements consistently with the existing dark navy/orange-red BharatSMM theme

**User-visible outcome:** Users on the Add Funds page can scan the PhonePe QR code or copy the UPI ID to make payments via any UPI app.
