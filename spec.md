# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Deploy the complete BharatSMM application as the live production version with all existing features intact.

**Planned changes:**
- Publish all frontend pages (Dashboard, New Order, Orders, Services, Add Funds, Profile, Admin Panel) to production
- Deploy the backend actor with all implemented functions (orders, balances, top-up requests, admin operations)
- Ensure the Admin Panel is accessible only to the admin principal
- Verify the dark navy/orange-red visual theme is consistently applied across all pages
- Confirm the sidebar renders the BharatSMM logo and all navigation links including the conditional Admin Panel entry
- Confirm the Add Funds page displays the UPI QR code and accepts deposits as low as ₹1
- Confirm service price editing works from the Admin Panel's Service Prices tab

**User-visible outcome:** The BharatSMM app is live and accessible at its production URL, with all pages and backend functionality fully operational.
